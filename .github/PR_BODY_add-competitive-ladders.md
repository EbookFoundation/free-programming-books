## For resources
### Description
Added four competitive-programming / interview-prep problem-sheet ladders to the `Ladders` section of `more/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md`:

- 450 DSA Sheet — Love Babbar: a comprehensive DSA problem list covering arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, DP, etc.
- Apna College DSA Sheet: curated problems suitable for beginners to advanced learners, tied to Apna College playlists and walkthroughs.
- Blind 75: the commonly referenced top 75 LeetCode problems for interview preparation.
- NeetCode 150: NeetCode’s collection of ~150 essential coding interview problems organized by topic.

Additionally, the `Ladders` section was alphabetized to comply with repository style guidelines.

### Why is this valuable (or not)?
These curated lists provide structured, progressive practice paths for learners preparing for competitive programming and technical interviews. They consolidate commonly recommended, high-value problems across topics and difficulty levels, which helps learners plan study and revision effectively.

### How do we know it's really free?
All referenced resources are publicly accessible without paywalls:

- Love Babbar and Apna College maintain public YouTube playlists or pages.
- Blind 75 is publicly shared via a LeetCode discussion / public mirrors.
- NeetCode practice pages are publicly accessible.

Links in the file point to public pages/collections.

### For book lists, is it a book? For course lists, is it a course? etc.
These entries are curated problem sheets / lists (not books or paid courses). Each entry includes the platform/author where appropriate.
