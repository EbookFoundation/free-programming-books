## Contribution Guidelines

* Keep the list **alphabetized**.
* Ensure links point to **free and legal** resources.
* Include **author names** and **format** (PDF, HTML, ePub, etc.).
* Prefer **official sources** over third-party hosting.
* Avoid **link shorteners** (e.g., `bit.ly`).
* If a book has multiple formats, list them together:
    * `* [Book Title](http://example.com) - Author Name (PDF, HTML)`
* If a resource is in-progress or archived, add a note like:
    * `* (:construction: in process)`
    * `* (:card_file_box: archived)`

* **Courses:** Learning material that is not a book. Include platform if needed.
* **Interactive Tutorials:** Websites where users type code/commands and get feedback.
* **Playgrounds:** Online or offline coding environments, games, or software for practice.
* **Podcasts and Screencasts:** Learning content in audio/video format.
* **Problem Sets & Competitive Programming:** Practice exercises and challenges.
