Welcome to Free-Programming-Books! We welcome new contributors; even those making their very first pull request on Github. If you're one of those, here are some resources that might help:

* [About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
* [Github Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Youtube - Github Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE)

Don't hesitate to ask questions; every contributor started with a first PR. You could be our thousandth!

Even if you're an experienced open source contributor, there are things that might trip you up. Once you've submitted your PR, Travis-CI will run a linter, often finding little issues with spacing or alphabetization. If you get a green button, everything is ready for review, but if not, click on the travis link to find out what the linter didn't like. Fix the problem and add a commit to your PR.

Finally, if you're not sure that the resource you want to add is appropriate for Free-Programming-Books, read through the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
