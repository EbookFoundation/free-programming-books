# Fix TailwindCSS Index Entry Formatting Issue

## Problem Description

There is a formatting issue in `books/free-programming-books-langs.md` at line 79 in the index section under HTML and CSS.

**Current (incorrect) entry:**
```markdown
* [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Adam Wathan
```

**Issues with this entry:**
1. Index entries should link to internal anchors (like `#tailwindcss`), not external URLs
2. Index entries should not include author names  
3. There is no corresponding `#### TailwindCSS` section in the HTML and CSS section
4. This violates the formatting guidelines specified in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Expected Solution

The entry should be formatted as:
```markdown
* [TailwindCSS](#tailwindcss)
```

And there should be a corresponding section in the HTML and CSS part with TailwindCSS resources.

## Contributing Guidelines Reference

According to `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`:
- All lists should follow proper Markdown formatting
- Index entries should link to sections within the same file
- External links belong in the actual content sections, not the index
