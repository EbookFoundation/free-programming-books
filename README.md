List of Free Learning Resources
===

Intro
---

If you want to find a learning resource, you should definitely check out our site, [Free Learning Resources](http://resrc.io).
And for those who want to learn a computer language, you should check out these books on [reSRC.io](http://resrc.io/list/10/list-of-free-programming-books/) or on [github](/free-programming-books.md).
This list initially was a clone of [stackoverflow - List of Freely Available Programming Books](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books/392926#392926) by George Stocker. Now updated, with dead links gone and new content.

Moved to GitHub for collaborative updating and for the site mentioned above.


### How To Contribute
It's [easy](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/wiki/Contribution).
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- Read the [TODO](/TODO.md) file(Adding new books is our #1 priority, but things like Alphabetizing are important, too.)
- Edit (we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change)
- [Send a PR](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
- be part of a project that over 16,000 people starred in 3 months. ;)

**Again, unlike other projects, we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change in a pull request - it's fine to have one PR, but please make sure your title reflects what you're changing**, thanks.
