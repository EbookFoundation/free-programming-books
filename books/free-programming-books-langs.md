## BY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Originally, this list included a section called "Language Agnostic" for books about programming subjects not restricted to a specific programming language.
That section got so big, we decided to split it into its own file, the [BY SUBJECT file](free-programming-books-subjects.md).
Books on general-purpose programming that don't focus on a specific language are in listed in the subject "Programming". Books on specialized topics are listed in their own sub-sections.
