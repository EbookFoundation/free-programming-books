Subject: Testing AI-assisted PR reviews for free-programming-books

Hi Eric,

Following up on your invitation to help review PRs for free-programming-books, I've been experimenting with using Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) to help systematically review submissions. I wanted to share an example review to get your thoughts on whether this approach could be useful for the project.

## Example: PR #11955 (Vietnamese book addition)

I had Claude Code analyze the PR that's currently failing the linter. It identified 7 specific issues:

1. Broken markdown format - missing `[Title](URL) - Author` structure
2. Placeholder title ("SÃ¡ch 2" instead of actual book name)
3. Missing author information
4. Wrong section (Python content in Machine Learning section)
5. Link to a blog review instead of the actual free book
6. Alphabetical ordering violation
7. Missing final blank line

The AI generated constructive feedback with specific examples of correct formatting and clear instructions for fixes.

## Potential Benefits

- **Consistency**: Reviews follow the contribution guidelines systematically
- **Comprehensive**: Catches multiple issues in a single pass
- **Educational**: Provides examples of correct formatting from the existing codebase
- **Scalable**: Could help with the backlog of PRs (some open for over a year)

## What I've Created

I've set up:
- A review tracking document (PR_REVIEWS.md) to monitor PR status
- A review process guide (REVIEW_PROCESS.md) with checklists and templates
- Detailed feedback templates that follow the repo's style

## Questions for You

1. Would this type of systematic review be helpful for the project?
2. Are there specific aspects of PRs you'd like prioritized in reviews?
3. Should I test this on a few more PRs of different types (translations, course additions, etc.)?
4. Any concerns or adjustments you'd suggest?

I can share the full review documents and feedback if you're interested. The AI approach seems particularly well-suited for free-programming-books because of the clear, well-documented contribution guidelines.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,
[Your name]
