PHP BASICS
Including PHP in a File
<?php
 // place PHP code here
?>
Writing Comments
// — Denotes comments that only span one line
# — Another way of producing single-line comments
/*...*/ — Everything between /* and */ is not executed, also works
 across several lines
Outputting Data
<?php
 echo "<h1>PHP Cheat Sheet</h1>";
?>

Types of Data
Integers
Integers are non-decimal numbers between -2,147,483,648 and ,
147,483,647. They must have at least one digit and no decimal point.
Can be in decimal, hexadecimal or octal.
Floats
This is the name for numbers with a decimal point or in exponential
form.
Strings
This simply means text, we will talk about it in detail further
below.
Boolean values
Meaning true/false statements.
Arrays
Arrays are variables that store several values. We will talk about
them in detail further below.
Objects
Objects store both data and information on how to process it.
Resources
These are references to functions and resources outside of PHP.
NULL
A variable that is NULL doesn’t have any value.
Variable Scope
function myFunction() {
 global $a, $b;
 $b = $a - $b;
}

PHP STRINGS
Defining Strings
Single quotes
This is the simplest way. Just wrap your text in ' markers and PHP
will handle it as a string.
Double quotes
As an alternative you can use ". When you do, it’s possible to use
the escape characters below to display special characters.
heredoc
Begin a string with <<< and an identifier, then put the string in a
new line. Close it in another line by repeating the
identifier. heredoc behaves like double-quoted strings.
nowdoc
Is what heredoc is for double-quoted strings but for single quotes.
It works the same way and eliminates the need for escape characters.
Escape Characters
\n — Linefeed
\r — Carriage return
\t — Horizontal tab
\v — Vertical tab
\e — Escape
\f — Form feed
\\ — Backslash
13 of 38
\$ — Dollar sign
\’ — Single quote
\" — Double quote
\[0-7]{1,3} — Character in octal notation
\x[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,2} — Character in hexadecimal notation

PHP OPERATORS
Arithmetic Operators
+ — Addition
- — Subtraction
* — Multiplication
/ — Division
% — Modulo (the remainder of value divided by another)
** — Exponentiation
Assignment Operators
+= — a += b is the same as a = a + b
-= — a -= b is the same as a = a – b
*= — a *= b is the same as a = a * b
/= — a /= b is the same as a = a / b
%= — a %= b is the same as a = a % b
Comparison Operators
== — Equal
20 of 38
=== — Identical
!= — Not equal
<> — Not equal
!== — Not identical
< — Less than
> — Greater than
<= — Less than or equal to
>= — Greater than or equal to

| — Or (inclusive or)
^ — Xor (exclusive or)
~ — Not
<< — Shift left
>> — Shift right
21 of 38
Error Control Operator
You can use the @ sign to prevent expressions from generating error
messages. This is often important for security reasons, for example
to keep confidential information safe.
Execution Operator
PHP supports one execution operator, which is `` (backticks). These
are not single-quotes! PHP will attempt to execute the contents of
the backticks as a shell command.
Increment/Decrement Operators
++$v — Increments a variable by one, then returns it
$v++ — Returns a variable, then increments it by one
--$v — Decrements the variable by one, returns it afterward
$v-- — Returns the variable then decrements it by one
String Operators
. — Used to concatenate (mean combine) arguments
.= — Used to append the argument on the right to the left-side
argument
LOOPS IN PHP
For Loop
for (starting counter value; ending counter value; increment by which
to increase) {
 // code to execute goes here
}
Foreach Loop
foreach ($InsertYourArrayName as $value) {
 // code to execute goes here
22 of 38
}
While Loop
while (condition that must apply) {
 // code to execute goes here
}
Do..While Loop
do {
 // code to execute goes here;
} while (condition that must apply);
CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
If Statement
if (condition) {
 // code to execute if condition is met
}
If..Else
if (condition) {
 // code to execute if condition is met
} else {
 // code to execute if condition is not met
}
If..Elseif..Else
if (condition) {
 // code to execute if condition is met
23 of 38
} elseif (condition) {
 // code to execute if this condition is met
} else {
 // code to execute if none of the conditions are met
}
Switch Statement
switch (n) {
 case x:
 code to execute if n=x;
 break;
 case y:
 code to execute if n=y;
 break;
 case z:
 code to execute if n=z;
 break;
 // add more cases as needed
 default:
 code to execute if n is neither of the above;
}
WORKING WITH FORMS IN PHP
Using GET vs POST
GET collects data via URL parameters. That means all variable names
and their values are contained in the page address.
24 of 38
The advantage of this is that you’re able to bookmark the
information. Keep in mind that it also means that the information is
visible to everyone. For that reason, GET is not suitable for
sensitive information such as passwords. It also limits the amount of
data that can be sent in ca 2000 characters.
POST, on the other hand, uses the HTTP POST method to pass on
variables. This makes the data invisible to third parties, as it is
sent in the HTTP body. You are not able to bookmark it.
With POST, there are no limits to the amount of information you can
send. Aside from that, it also has advanced functionality and is
therefore preferred by developers.
Form Security
PHP offers tools to thwart those attacks, namely:
htmlspecialchars()
trim()
stripslashes()
Required Fields, Error Messages and Data Validation
Aside from that, PHP is able to define required fields (you can’t
submit the form without filling them out), display error messages if
some information is missing and to validate data. We have already
talked about the necessary tools to do so.
For example, you can simply define variables for your form fields and
use the empty() function to check if they have values. After that,
create a simple if/else statement to either send the submitted data
or output an error message.
The next step is to check submitted data for validity. For that, PHP
offers a number of filters such as FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL to make sure
a submitted email address has the right format.
